# C3D-ANIMATION #

This Matlab c3d animation code provides animation of c3d files. 
Users are able to check the positions of the markers at specific frame. 
By importing specific cluster json file, the code is able to plot markers in desired cluster. 
The code is also able to plot a reference coordinate system for each cluster by importing specific json file.
Please see instruction below for making a proper json file.



# Documentation #

A pdf of how to make a proper json file is included. 
general_slider.m implements the animation in GUI. 
slider_animation.m is the simpler version and it can implement the animation in a smoother way. 
All files in the C3DSERVER are from Motion Lab Systems, Inc. (<http://www.motion-labs.com/>) and they are necessary for the operation of this program. 



# Execution #

Download all the files into one folder, then run either general_slider.m or slider_animation.m depends on what you need.
